## PID Gain Tuning Using a Dedicated Test Stand

### Preparation for tuning PID gains
![OnBench](https://github.com/PanBabinicz/ghost-feather/blob/master/doc/hardware/ghost-feather-v1/screenshots/real-drone-prepared-for-tuning.jpg)

> To obtain accurate and repeatable PID gains for the drone, a **dedicated tuning stand** is used. This setup allows controlled
> testing of the control system without the risks and external disturbances associated with free flight.

### 🧩 Purpose

> The tuning stand isolates the drone’s rotational axes (typically roll and pitch) while:
> * preventing full movement or lift-off
> * allowing safe application of control inputs
>
> This creates a controlled environment for systematic PID tuning.

### ⚙️ Setup

> The drone is mounted on a mechanical frame that:
> * constrains motion to one axis at a time
> * minimizes friction and external disturbances
> * allows sensors (e.g., IMU) to operate normally
>
> Only the axis under test (e.g., roll) is left free to rotate, while others are fixed.

### 🔄 Tuning Procedure

#### 1. Proportional Gain (Kp)
> * Start with `Ki = 0`, `Kd = 0`
> * Gradually increase `Kp` until the system responds quickly to disturbances
> * Identify the point where oscillations begin, then slightly reduce `Kp`

#### 2. Derivative Gain (Kd)
> * Increase `Kd` to dampen oscillations
> * Adjust until the system stabilizes quickly without overshoot

#### 3. Integral Gain (Ki)
> * Introduce `Ki` to eliminate steady-state error
> * Increase slowly to avoid drift or slow oscillations
