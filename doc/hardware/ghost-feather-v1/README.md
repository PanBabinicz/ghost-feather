# Ghost Feather v1 👻

## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> **Please bear in mind that the pcb was primarily created for enjoyment
> and educational endeavors.**
 
> Ghost Feather v1 is a compact, four-layer PCB built for embedded systems and robotics exploration 🤖.
> Designed with versatility and performance in mind, it brings together a robust set of components for
> a wide range of applications.
>
> This is the first version of the board, featuring only basic functionality – telemetry and advanced
> features are not yet included.

> ✨ Key Features
>
> - 🧠 STM32F722RET6 – Powerful Cortex-M7 MCU at the heart of the board
>
> - 🌀 BMI270 IMU – 6-axis motion sensing for orientation and motion tracking
>
> - 🧪 Voltage Level Shifters – Built using MOSFETs to safely bridge logic levels
>
> - 🛠️ SWD Tag Connector – For easy debugging and programming
>
> - 🔌 4x PicoBlade Connectors – For connecting ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)
>
> - 📡 1x PicoBlade Connector – For connecting an RF radio module
